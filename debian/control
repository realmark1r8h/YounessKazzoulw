Description: utilities to configure the UKUI desktop
 The UKUI control center contains configuration applets for the UKUI desktop,
 allowing to set accessibility configuration, desktop fonts, keyboard
 and mouse properties, sound setup, desktop theme and background, user
 interface properties, screen resolution, and other MATE parameters.
 .
 It also contains a front end to these applets, which can also be
 accessed with the UKUI panel or the Caja file manager.
